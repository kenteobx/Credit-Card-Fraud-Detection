# Credit Card Fraud Detection
## About the project
Due to the vast volume of daily transactions, financial institutions face significant challenges in detecting and preventing fraudulent card transactions. Traditional fraud detection systems often fail to adapt to the speed of the evolving fraud tactics, resulting in undetected fraud that not only inconvenience customers and merchants but can also lead to losses in financial institutions.
This project aims to develop a data-driven fraud detection system that is capable of accurately identifying fraudulent activities using card transactions. By leveraging data analysis and a range of algorithms, this projects aims to accurately identify fraudulent activities, strengthening financial risk management systems.
