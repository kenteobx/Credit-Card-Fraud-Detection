# Instructions for Random Forest processed datasets
In rf_splits folder, there is 4 datasets to be used for random forest model:
* `test_X.csv`
* `test_y.csv`
* `train_X.csv`
* `train_y.csv`

`test_X.csv` and `train_X.csv` are too big to be uploaded to GitHub. Please run `feature_eng_rf.ipynb` in `Notebooks/Feature Engineering/` folder to get these 2 datasets.
